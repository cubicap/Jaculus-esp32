    config JAC_ESP32_ENABLE_BLE
        bool "Enable BLE Stream Support"
        default y
        help
            Enable BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) stream support for wireless communication.
            This allows the ESP32 to act as a BLE GATT server that can be used
            as a communication transport alongside UART, TCP, and JTAG streams.

            When enabled:
            - BLE stack will be initialized
            - GATT server with custom service will be created
            - Device will be discoverable as "ESP32_JAC_BLE_XXXX" (XXXX = MAC suffix)
            - BLE stream will be available on mux channel 4

            When disabled:
            - BLE functionality is completely removed from build
            - Reduces binary size and memory usage
            - BT component dependency is optional

    config JAC_ESP32_BLE_DEVICE_NAME
        string "BLE Device Name Prefix"
        depends on JAC_ESP32_ENABLE_BLE
        default "ESP32_JAC_BLE"
        help
            The prefix for the BLE device name. The actual device name will be
            this prefix followed by the last 2 bytes of the MAC address.
            For example: "ESP32_JAC_BLE_A1B2"

    config JAC_ESP32_BLE_SERVICE_UUID
        hex "BLE GATT Service UUID (16-bit)"
        depends on JAC_ESP32_ENABLE_BLE
        default 0x00FF
        range 0x0001 0xFFFE
        help
            The 16-bit UUID for the custom BLE GATT service.
            Default is 0x00FF (255 in decimal).

    config JAC_ESP32_BLE_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID
        hex "BLE GATT Characteristic UUID (16-bit)"
        depends on JAC_ESP32_ENABLE_BLE
        default 0xFF01
        range 0x0001 0xFFFE
        help
            The 16-bit UUID for the BLE GATT characteristic used for data transfer.
            Default is 0xFF01 (65281 in decimal).

    config JAC_ESP32_BLE_MTU_SIZE
        int "BLE MTU Size"
        depends on JAC_ESP32_ENABLE_BLE
        default 500
        range 23 512
        help
            Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size for BLE communication.
            Larger values allow more data per packet but may not be supported
            by all devices. Default is 500 bytes.

    config JAC_ESP32_BLE_DEBUG_LOGS
        bool "Enable BLE Debug Logging"
        depends on JAC_ESP32_ENABLE_BLE
        default n
        help
            Enable detailed debug logging for BLE operations.
            This will show step-by-step initialization, connection events,
            and data transfer details. Useful for debugging but increases
            log output significantly.
